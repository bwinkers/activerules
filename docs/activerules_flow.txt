ActiveRules Flow
================

index.php
---------

1.	Output buffer

	We start an output buffer to catch any accidental echos at this level.
	This gets flushed at the end of the index file if we get that far.

2.	Set ActiveRules startup Constants

	We set AR_START_TIME and AR_START_MEMORY as references.
	Profiling and reporting functions can reference these constants.
	AR_START_TIME provides a timestamp guaranteed to be the consistent throughout execution. 

3.	Define the PHP extension 

	We set EXT as '.php' to append to strings for class filenames etc.
	It would also help if we ever head to support using a different extension like '.php6'.

4.	Define the ActiveRules version

	A check AR_VERSION being defined is at the top of every file but the index.php file.
	This prevents those files from being called directly regardless of the server setup or security.
	This version number can also be referenced for enabling/disabling features.
	To provide granularity the version number should contain a major and minor version number. (7.0, 7.1, 7.2, etc)

5.	Define the DOCROOT

	This is the root install directory.
	ActiveRules is written to be run inside a PHP container, meaning that the index file is at the web root and all other files are in sub-directories.
	This runs counter to the well accepted practice of having most of the application files outside of the web root.

6.	Include the bootstrap config

	The first thing this provides is the location of the 'activerules' directory.
	The part of ActiveRules responsible for loading the proper modules for a site is here.

	This also defines three possible services for ActiveRules to use.
	These are storage, caching and logging services.
	These can be used to provide services to underlying sites, modules or applications.
	Though for good separation of responsibility it is strongly suggested that at minimum those be defined separately at the site level.
	Best practices would have each module and application define those service independently as well.

	At minimum the 'storage' needs to be configured so that AR can find the site configuration data.

7.	Define ACTIVEPATH 

	This points to the realpath of activerules as defined in the bootstrap config.

8.	Require the Activerules_AR class

9.	Register the ActiveRules class autoloader

	This allows us to use classes without having to explicitly include their files first.
	It also supports a cascading file system that allows modules to overload core ActiveRules functionality.
	The basic concept here was borrowed from Kohana.

10. Create a boostrap config array

	This array is used to pass the services defined in bootstrap config to the AR class. 

11. Create an AR (ActiveRules) instance

	We pass it the bootstrap config array and load the Site.
	AR does pass its defined storage to Site since it must have a way to find stored data.

	The AR instance is a singleton. 
	It's purpose is to handle passing a web request to the defined application or module for a given site.
	There shouldn't need to be a whole lot of singletons in the code.


AR Class
--------

### instance()

This returns the singleton instance and populates static variables.

### __construct()

Currently nothing happens here

### configure($ar_bootstrap_configs)

We use the bootstrap configured services to load a storage class.

### load_site()

This creates $site as a newly initialized Site object instance, passing it the AR storage object.
The site alias is determined within the Site object by creating a Hostname object.
This Hostname object remains part of the static AR objects static Site.

The Site and Site Hostname objects of the initial web request can be accessed as needed by ANY module using the AR static method calls.
These are meant to be treated as global variables that represent this unique request.
This is the core functionality of ActiveRules from a framework perspective.
It allows setting multi-dimensional variables that can be used to dynamically alter the code execution at any point within a module.
